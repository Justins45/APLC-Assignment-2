# Part 3: Writing the Program in Python

1. Replicate the functionality of the enrollment management program developed in Part 2 using the Python programming language. Verify that the output produced by your Python program matches the output generated by the program developed in Part 2. This includes the format, content, and accuracy of any messages, prompts or results displayed to the user.
2. Include comments and descriptive variable names within your Python code to enhance readability and maintainability. Explain any complex logic or decision-making processes to facilitate understanding for yourself and others who may review the code.
3. Test your Python program to ensure its correctness, functionality and compatibility with the specified requirements.
      -  Compare the output of your Python program with the output of the program developed in Part 2 to validate consistency and correctness across both implementations.
